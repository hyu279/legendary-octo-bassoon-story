Once upon a time, there was a legendary octopus who lives under the sea.
One day, he ate a fish.
End of the story.  


No no no... that was not the end of story. 
Before he ate the fish, something else happened. 
That day, the legendary octopus tried to eat a slippery oyster. 
Before he knew it, he got tangled in his own tentacles, he couldn't 
move. He was asking everybody for help but nobody wanted to help him. 
The little fish was the only one who felt compassionate enough to 
stop and help the legendary octopus. 
Then he got eaten 😆
LOL

But the story goes even farther than that. The little fish actually came from
the future and the fish came to help the octopus because it was crucial
that the octopus survived. Once the fish untangled the octopus, the fish asked
for the octopus to tell it where he kept his oyester reserve. This octopus
was considered to have largest oyester reserve in the ocean, but because nobody
helped him the first time, the octopus got eaten by a shark, leaving no knowledge
of his oyester reserve.

The ocotopus left clues around the ocean and unfortunately the clues were discovered 
by a shark and his gang. The shark planned to devour the entire oyster reserve.

This story really is legendary! 
I had a really good time reading it (and not getting eaten!)

The fish was not resigned to give up the oyester. So he asked the octopus to
help him find the shark. After a several days searching, they finally find the
shark at the bottom of the sea. They saw that the shark was just taking out the
oyster from a really secret place.

The shark said: "Did you find that fish? Bring him to me!"
Oyster: "I will, but please don't hurt my families"
"I will keep my promise", said the Shark with a sinister smile.
