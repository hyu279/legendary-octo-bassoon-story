Once upon a time, there was a legendary octopus who lives under the sea.
One day, he ate a fish.
End of the story.  


No no no... that was not the end of story. 
Before he ate the fish, something else happened. 
That day, the legendary octopus tried to eat a slippery oyster. 
Before he knew it, he got tangled in his own tentacles, he couldn't 
move. He was asking everybody for help but nobody wanted to help him. 
The little fish was the only one who felt compassionate enough to 
stop and help the legendary octopus. 
Then he got eaten ðŸ˜†
LOL
